# Pychipher
Python tool to cipher text

Just a little tool to use if you want to cipher any text.
The basic syntax would be 'python {cipher}.py {string}' (The words in curly brackets are basically which file you choose and what word you want to cipher)

Do take note that when you want to cipher a sentence, you have to put it in quotation marks or else it will only cipher the first word
in your sentence.

P.S. 
This is my first public repository I've published. I'm also still a beginner at programming so the code may look crappy lol
In the future I will try to make changes since I'm still improving and practicing. 

ANYWAYS have fun with the code and whatever slkdjflksjflksjdlkjsdfds
